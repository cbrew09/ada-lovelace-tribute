# ada-lovelace-tribute
A simple tribute to Ada Lovelace including a brief biography and timeline of key dates.

My eventual project with this page would be to make a website dedicated to either women in code, or women in science to introduce people to people like Ada Lovelace or Grace Hopper. As of now its going to be just a tribute page for Ada.
