                <h2>The World's First Computer Programmer</h2>
                <p>Though what we consider to be something close to a modern computer 
                    wouldn't be invented until long after her death, Ada Lovelace is 
                    considered by many to be the first computer programmer. The daughter of 
                    Lord and Lady Byron, the former of whom is the famous poet known for <i>"Don Juan"</i>,
                    Lovelace was born December 10, 1815. Lady Byron, who did not want her to turn out like her
                    father, had her tutored almost exclusively in Mathetmatics. 
                    <br>
                    In June 1833, she met Charles Babbage with who invited her to take a look at a prototype of his Difference Engine.
                    From 1942-1943, Lovelace began translating an article by Mathematician Luigi Menabrea on 
                    Babbage's Analytical Engine, as well as wrote a set of notes appended to the translation. 
                    Within these notes she described an algorithm for the Analytical Engine to compute Bernoulli numbers. 
                    This algorithm is considered to be the first published computer program specifically for use on a
                    computer. 
                    <br>
                    For her creation of this algorithm, she is considered to be the world's first computer programmer
                    and has left an legacy of women in code, one which for a long time was not acknowledged. Hopefully,
                    we can do better and open up coding to people of all different types, with different backgrounds.
